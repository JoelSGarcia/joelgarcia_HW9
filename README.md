Web form application for BAIS3300 HW9

# Tech Survey Web Form

## Project Description

This project is a web form application for collecting technology usage data, consisting of four pages: a welcome page, two data collection pages, and a thank you page. It is built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 5.3, and Font Awesome, and deployed on Azure.

## Form Best Practices

The web form follows best practices to ensure usability and accessibility. Clear labels are provided for all form fields, making it easy for users to understand what information is required. The form uses required field validators and autofocus to guide users through the process, ensuring essential fields are not missed and the user experience is streamlined.

Additionally, the form is responsive, adapting seamlessly to both desktop and mobile devices using Bootstrap 5.3’s grid system. Navigation between pages is intuitive, with “Next” and “Finish” buttons that guide users through the survey flow without confusion.

## Accessibility Best Practices

The form is designed to be accessible to all users, meeting WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards. Semantic HTML is used with proper labels and ARIA attributes (e.g., `aria-label` on the tooltip icon) to ensure screen readers can interpret the form. Color contrast meets accessibility guidelines, and the form is navigable via keyboard, ensuring inclusivity for users with disabilities.
